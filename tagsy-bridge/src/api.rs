//! Dart-facing API surface.
//!
//! This is the thin layer `flutter_rust_bridge` generates Dart bindings for. It
//! deliberately adds **no** business logic: it owns a [`RuntimeHandle`] and
//! forwards every call to the [`AnyBackend`], which forwards to the
//! [`ApiService`](tagsyd::frontend::api::ApiService). The Dart UI holds one
//! [`Tagsy`] and never learns which transport backs it.
//!
//! Two conventions make this layer usable from Dart, and both are load-bearing:
//! every id is a `String` (see the string-id section on [`Tagsy`]), and
//! every type crossing the boundary is either a flat DTO defined here or a
//! mirrored enum — never an opaque Rust handle. An opaque handle reaches Dart
//! as a pointer with no fields and no `toString()`, which is unusable and
//! fails silently rather than loudly.
//!
//! The `#[flutter_rust_bridge::frb]` annotations are applied only when the
//! `flutter_rust_bridge` feature is enabled (via `cfg_attr`), so the crate
//! still compiles — and `cargo check` still passes — without the generator's
//! dependency present.

// Re-exported (not just `use`d) so the types appearing in this module's
// `#[frb]`-annotated signatures are reachable via `crate::api::*` — which is
// exactly how `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` references them in the generated
// `frb_generated.rs`. A plain private `use` would not be visible through that
// glob and the generated code fails to compile.
