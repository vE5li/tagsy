//! The catalog message vocabulary.
//!
//! One `mpsc` channel carries messages from every producer (the UI-facing
//! [`ApiService`], the sync-directory watcher, and inbound peer sessions) to
//! the single `handle_changes` task, which is the sole DB writer.
//!
//! [`CatalogCommand`] is an enum so the same ordered FIFO can carry both
//! fire-and-forget mutations and a request-reply message
//! ([`CatalogCommand::Fetch`]) used by `tagsy edit` to pull a file's bytes
//! from a peer on demand. Keeping everything on one channel (rather than a
//! second channel + `select!`) preserves the order of a producer's messages
//! relative to each other — e.g. an edit enqueued just before a fetch of the
//! same file — and reuses one set of clone/drain/shutdown wiring.
//!
//! The reply travels back out-of-band via the `oneshot` carried in the `Fetch`
//! variant, mirroring the `SyncDirectoryCommand::ReadFile { respond_to }`
//! idiom. This is what lets the control layer stay decoupled from the peer/sync
//! machinery: it only ever holds an
//! [`ApiService`](crate::frontend::api::ApiService), which enqueues a
//! `Fetch` and awaits the `oneshot`; the recursive fetch engine that talks to
//! peers lives entirely in `handle_changes`/the peer sessions.

///   `FileMetadataAdded`/`FileMetadataChanged` to peers.
/// - [`Ingest::Meta`] — any change that carries no local bytes, held as the
///   wire [`Change`]. This includes every inbound peer change: a peer's
