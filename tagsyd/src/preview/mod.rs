//! Local preview generation.
//!
//! Turns a file's raw bytes into a small [`Preview`] — a low-resolution image,
//! a short text snippet, or [`Preview::None`] for anything we can't (or won't)
//! preview. This is the *producer* side of the preview feature; caching,
//! invalidation, and peer fetch live elsewhere (`store/previews.rs`,
//! `peer/relay/previews.rs`).
//!
//! This module owns the shared plumbing — the byte caps, the source reader, and
//! the [`classify`] type-detector — and dispatches to one backend per kind,
//! each in its own submodule with no shared state:
//!
//! - [`image`] — raster images, via the `image` crate.
//! - [`pdf`] — first-page render, via pdfium.
//! - [`video`] — one frame, via a pinned ffmpeg/ffprobe.
//! - [`text`] — a sanitized UTF-8 snippet.
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Previews are keyed by `(file_id, content_hash)` in the cache and on the
//! wire, and every peer runs this same generator. They are deterministic *in
//! kind* (the same bytes always yield an image, or always text, or always
//! none), but the exact encoded bytes of an image preview are **not** required
//! to be identical across peers — image-codec output can differ by library
//! version. Any valid preview of the requested content is acceptable, which is
//! why the peer-fetch layer takes the first responder and drops the rest.
//!
//! ## Blocking
//!
//! Decoding, resizing, and re-encoding an image is CPU-bound and must never run
//! on a Tokio worker thread. Call [`generate`] from inside
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`; it is a plain synchronous function for
//! exactly that reason. Because it already runs on the blocking pool, it reads
//! its source ([`FileBytes`]) with synchronous `std::fs`, avoiding a second
//! async hop — and, crucially, letting the file-backed video path hand ffmpeg
//! the source's *own* on-disk path instead of copying it through memory into a
//! throwaway temp file.

///
/// `extension` is the file's lowercase extension (no dot, e.g. `"jpg"`) taken

/// stored without an extension, and magic-byte sniffing occasionally misses
/// (unusual leading bytes, truncated reads), so the extension is a valuable

/// - `None` — the source could not be read at all (e.g. the file vanished
///   between an earlier presence check and this call). The caller should treat
///   this as "no preview *this time*" and fall back to asking peers, rather
///   than caching a spurious negative.

/// preview a peer (or a later retry) could still produce.
