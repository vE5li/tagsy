/*
 * Single source of truth for the tagsy engine's startup inputs on Android.
 *
 * The engine needs three strings at start-up (a JSON configuration, a data
 * directory, and an identity-file path, both app-private) plus an optional
 * backup directory, mirroring the daemon binary's `TAGSY_BACKUP_DIR`
 * — unset here for now, since Android has no UI/config decision
 * for where on-device backups would go yet.
 *
 * The JSON is bundled into the APK as an Android asset at
 * `assets/tagsy_config.json`. The file is *not* source: it is copied in at
 * build time by the flake's `run-android` apps from `app/config/<name>.json`,
 * selected by the `TAGSY_CONFIG` env var — that is how one repository can
 * flash two devices with different peer configs. Editing peer identities
 * therefore means editing files under `app/config/`, not this class.
 *
 * A trivial `$DOCUMENTS` placeholder in the JSON is substituted for the
 * device's public Documents directory (resolved via [Environment] at runtime),
 * so the config file itself contains no device-specific paths.
 *
 * Both callers use [TagsyConfig.build]:
 *   * [TagsyService] (Kotlin) uses it to feed nativeStart.
 *   * [MainActivity] exposes the same values to Dart over a MethodChannel
 *     (see [CHANNEL_NAME]); AndroidBootstrap.connect() reads them from there
 *     and passes them to TagsyApp.start (which is idempotent — since the
 *     service has already started the runtime, the Dart-side JSON is just an
 *     assertion that it wants the same configuration).
