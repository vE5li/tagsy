// Platform-agnostic contract for launching an external editor on a file and
// waiting until the user is done editing it.
//
// The Flutter "edit" action in the file detail screen is a thin driver over
// the daemon's stateless edit protocol (see Tagsy.beginEdit /
// finishEdit / cancelEdit): it asks the daemon for a path, hands the
// path to a launcher implementing this interface, and — once the launcher
// resolves — hands the path back for hash-and-maybe-upload.
//
// The "wait" part is what differs between platforms:
//
//   * Linux: `Process.start` the resolved editor and `await exitCode`. The
//     editor blocks in the foreground, so the exit is a reliable "user is
//     done" signal.
//   * Android: fire an `ACTION_EDIT` intent for a FileProvider URI and await
//     the next `onResume` of MainActivity. External editors do not reliably
//     return a result to us via `startActivityForResult`, so "the user came
//     back to tagsy" is the strongest signal available.
//
// Each platform's bootstrap plugs a concrete [EditorLauncher] into the
// [TagsySession] (null on platforms without one). The file detail screen
// only shows its Edit button when the session carries a launcher.

/// they need — MethodChannels, config lookups, …) and reused for the app's
/// lifetime. Each `launchAndWait` call is one editing session; concurrent
/// calls are not supported (nothing prevents them, but the Android impl in
/// particular has one process-wide "who is expecting the next onResume?" slot
/// and would confuse two overlapping edits).
abstract class EditorLauncher {
  /// Open [path] in an external editor and return once the user is done.
  ///
  /// [rules] is the daemon-configured query → `argv` mapping (see
  /// [tagsy.EditorRuleEntry]); implementations that consult rules (Linux)
  /// walk it in declaration order, first match wins. Implementations that
  /// ignore rules (Android — the OS picks the editor by MIME) may leave it
  /// unused.
  ///
  /// [fileId] is the id of the file being edited, so a rule's `query` can be
  /// evaluated against exactly this file (the Linux impl composes
  /// `/i <fileId> <rule.query>` and runs it through the daemon's query path).
  /// A query keys off the full filtering grammar rather than a bare tag
  /// membership test, and — like matching by tag id — it survives a
  /// `rename_tag` because a `/t` term resolves to an id up front.
  ///
  /// [logicalName] is the file's user-facing name (last component of the
  /// logical path). Used by the Android impl to sniff a MIME hint from the
  /// extension.
