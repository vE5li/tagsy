// Platform-agnostic startup contract shared by the Android and Linux apps.
//
// The ONLY real difference between the two apps is how a live [tagsy.Tagsy]
// handle is obtained:
//
//   * Android starts an in-process sync engine (owns the DB + identity) and
//     also shows the device public key and accepts files from the share sheet.
//   * Linux attaches to a systemd daemon over IPC; the daemon owns everything,
//     so there is no public key to show and no share intent here.
//
// Everything AFTER a handle exists (listing files/tags, the change-stream loop,
// the widget tree) is identical and lives in the shared UI (../app.dart,
// ../screens/). To keep that UI free of any platform imports, each platform
// implements this [TagsyBootstrap] and hands back a [TagsySession].
